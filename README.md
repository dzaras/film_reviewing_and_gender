# film_reviewing_and_gender
The R script 'gender_matching_glmm_11-21-20' contains a number of multilevel models for the dependent variables that measure whether the author of a film review is female or male
 (author.female) and whether a given film review is favorable or not. The data that these models use are film reviews collected from US newspapers in three points in time (1998, 2008, 2018). The various multilevel models contains different combinations of fixed effects and random effects. Also, the last part of the script contains code for
 visualizing the effects of the random and fixed effects of the models.
