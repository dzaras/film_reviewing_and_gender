    "## What is BERT?\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT is short for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. You don't need to understand every part of that title. Google defines it as \"a neural network-based technique for natural language processing (NLP) pre-training,\" and continues:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This technology enables anyone to train their own state-of-the-art question answering system. This breakthrough was the result of Google research on transformers: models that process words in relation to all the other words in a sentence, rather than one-by-one in order. BERT models can therefore consider the full context of a word by looking at the words that come before and after it—particularly useful for understanding the intent behind search queries.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about how sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and word2vec work: they all track text by taking words \"one-by-one in order\". BERT looks forward and back: hence \"Bidirectional.\" Can you see why BERT is an exciting advance?"

    "## Why BERT?\n",
    "\n",
    "Progress has been rapidly accelerating in machine learning models that process language. This progress has left the research lab and started powering some of the leading digital products. A great example of this is [the announcement in October 2019 of how the BERT model is now a major force behind Google Search](https://www.blog.google/products/search/search-language-understanding-bert/), which I quoted from above. Google believes this progress in NLP represents “the biggest leap forward in the past five years, and one of the biggest leaps forward in the history of Search”."

    "## What we'll do today\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will BERT to process some text. We will use the output to classify the text. The text is a list of sentences from film reviews. And we will classify each sentence as either speaking \"positively\" about its subject or \"negatively\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we're returning to our first test analysis task: sentiment analysis — only a much more sophisticated version!\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the limitations of sentiment analysis? It looked at individual words and gave them scores. Each word's score was averaged from its possible meanings. And each sentence's score was an average of its words. This method led to plenty of inaccuracy, not least because it struggled to understand elements of context, such as, occasionally, negation, irony, and sarcasm.\n",
    "\n",
    "With BERT, we can process sentences to encode contextual information as embeddings. Then we can train a scikit-learn logistic regression classifier with these embeddings, creating a model that can take new sentences and classify them as positive or negative with FAR more accuracy than our old sentiment analysis dictionaries."

It's faster that way. For that reason, we need to pad all lists to the same size, so we can represent the input as one 2d array, rather than a list of lists (of different lengths)."
